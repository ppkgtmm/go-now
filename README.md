# go now

A simple web app help choosing places for trips in each season. Users can find places to travel in each season or randomly pick a place.
This project was built to help learning about front-end responsive web development using javascript framework (React JS). There were some back-end work like connecteing to a cloud storage to retrive image metadata (URL) involved. The data used was manually collected from many sites.
I started the project and completed it in the first half of 2020 but found that there were many things I could improve. So, I decided to refactor the project and use helping tools to save time and effort. The latest version of project is built using

-   Create React App
-   Redux
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Lodash
-   Feather Icons
-   Firebase admin
-   Netlify (deployment)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
